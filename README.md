This is a shopify backend project

The server.js launches a connection to the database

routes.js has all the CRUD APIs

shipment.js is the function responsible for creating shipments (optional point 3) by adjusting the inventory appropriately

Start the server by running "node[mon] server.js".
Once the server is up and running, we can perform various opperations through Postman or any other API caller to check the functionality. 

Run shipment.js (for testing input given) using `node shipment.js`
